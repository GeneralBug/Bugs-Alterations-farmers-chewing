# Bug's Alterations - Farmer's Chewing
Datapack making some changes to [Brewin' And Chewin' \[Fabric\]](https://modrinth.com/mod/brewin-and-chewin-fabric), including:
 - Fixed some issues with tags in some recipes (I think this is just my particular mod pack, not sure what other mod is breaking them though)
 - Pizza now uses tomato sauce and can be made with dough similarly to cake
 - Changed recipes to use dough tag for compatibility
 - Cheese recipes now use salt instead of sugar (if you have a mod that adds salt)
 - Also some compatibility stuff for Delightful Creators and a couple of other mods, such as a sequenced assembly recipe for pizza
 - Fixed the electrum knife/machete from the fabric port of Oreganized
